# Restaurant Forecasts

The goal of this project was to predict the annual revenue of a restaurant given certain information about it. Data containing variables such as city and restaurant type were obtained from TFI (through Kaggle). After preprocessing, random forests were applied to the training data to make testing predictions and glean insight into the importance of the various features provided. At a larger scale, this same methodology can be applied by businessowners to assess the viability of opening a particular restaurant at a certain location.
